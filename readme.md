##Objective of collaborative build:

    - Built within one html file using html, css, and javascript
    - See the same things from different perspectives
    - Learn by reference to similar concepts and ideas
        - I did X when attempting A, I see you did Y instead and it looks more effeicient. I'll attempt to adopt Y instead of X.
    - Very basic in terms of web technology potential
        - Starting at ground level and mastering the basics of web technologies
        - Frameworks are great, but knowing how to use the language before stringing together near incoherant strings is better.
    - Better interpretation of skill level when pooled with other developers
        - Learn of personal strengths and weaknesses.
    - Competitive has its place but the tenacity that competing takes changes the dynamic of the learning experience. 
        - The goal remains focused on developing a personal best
            - ie. How to reach, if only for a moment, a person best
        - [Does competition increase or decrease personal growth?]
            - Hmmmmm
